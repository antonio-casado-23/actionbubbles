ABOUT
-----

With Router Remote you can connect to your router and change the configuration, 
restart it, and many other things from your phone. Currently only Zyxel routers 
supported, but it would possible to make it work with other routers as well. 
Please report non-working routers, since support might be added. It uses the 
android library Ohmenu available at http://github.com/omtinez/ohmenu to implement 
an intuitive, modern user interface to the application menu.
